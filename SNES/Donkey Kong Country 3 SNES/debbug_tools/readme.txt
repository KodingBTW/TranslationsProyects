NOTES:

- Completing the Crystal Grotto using the WATER code will grant you 99 Bear Coins and 90 Bonus Coins.
- Choosing any of Funky Kong’s vehicles would always be the Gyrocopter. (Overwritten the Funky dialogue timer.)
- START + SELECT to exit the stage on incomplete levels.
- Walk through boulders in Krematoa.
- Walk anywhere on all map screens. (Except Squirt’s Showdown & Barbo’s Barrier which the player needs to complete before unlocking.)
- Using the Warp Barrel in Riverside Race would continue the clock instead of 9:59:00.
- Harder Simon Says/Memory Game patterns in Crystal Grottos almost like the GBA version of Donkey Kong Country 3.
